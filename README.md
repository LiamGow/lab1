Hey there, just realized we didn't exchange info.  My bad.

I talked to the professor, and she said we want the test suite to just be an input file itself, not something that inputs input files.
We're basically one level of indirection too high.

I'll start working on the test suite file to show you what she was talking about.  (It's basically the same as the example test suite - I just didn't understand what it was saying.
